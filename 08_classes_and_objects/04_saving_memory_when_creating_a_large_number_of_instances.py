    For classes that primarily serve as simple data structures, you can often
    greatly reduce the memory footprint of instances by adding the __slots__
    attribute to the class definition.

    When you define __slots__ , Python uses a much more compact internal
    representation for instances. Instead of each instance consisting of a
    dictionary, instances are built around a small fixed-sized array, much
    like a tuple or list. Attribute names listed in the __slots__ specifier
    are internally mapped to specific indices within this array. A side effect
    of using slots is that it is no longer possible to add new attributes to
    instances, you are restricted to only those attribute names listed in the
    __slots__ specifier.

    __slots__ = ['year', 'month', 'day']

    def __init__(self, year, month, day):
        self.year = year
        self.month = month
        self.day = day
